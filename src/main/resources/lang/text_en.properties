tutorial.exit=When the three correct terminals are activated, the goat must go through the exit to win the game.
tutorial.goat=The goat must escape the lab within a limited time while hiding from the guard. To help it hide more effectively, the goat has a unique ability to jump through windows. If an iGoat gets caught, the goat can rescue it by pressing the action button either at the spot where it was caught or at the iGoat loading station.
tutorial.guard=The guard must catch all the goats using the action button to win, or prevent the real goat from escaping within the time limit. The lab is dark, so the guard has to navigate using a flashlight.
tutorial.igoat=The iGoat must activate terminals using the action button to open the exits from the lab or to help the real goat escape if it gets caught by the guard.
tutorial.igoat_station=The iGoat loading station must be activated by the goat if an iGoat gets caught by the guard. Each station can only be activated once.
tutorial.terminal=There are a total of eight terminals in the lab. In each round, three random terminals must be activated by the iGoat to open the exit for the goat. If the goat gets caught by the guard, a random terminal must be activated. Each terminal can only be activated once per round.
tutorial.window=Only the goat can go through the windows— for all other players, the path remains blocked.
